# Node.js Webstreams

This is a repository with a simple test I made, consuming a huge CSV file with Node.js and vanilla JS in the frontend. Even the CSV is really big, it doesn't cause any problem neither on frontend or backend, because of the new Node.js Webstreams features, which allow you to consume files on-demand, flushing this space in memory for the new "chunk" of the file.
